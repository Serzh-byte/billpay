# Recent Fixes - Bill Pay App

## Date: October 21, 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Menu Item Images Not Displaying
**Problem:** Menu items were showing without images on the menu page.

**Root Cause:** The seed data wasn't including `image_url` values for menu items.

**Solution:**
- Updated `server/core/management/commands/seed.py` to include Unsplash image URLs for all 15 menu items
- Cleared existing menu items from database with `clear_menu.py`
- Re-ran seed command to populate database with images
- Images are now properly flowing through: Django API → Next.js API → Frontend components

**Image URLs Added:**
- Appetizers: Spring Rolls, Chicken Wings, Calamari
- Main Courses: Grilled Salmon, Ribeye Steak, Chicken Parmesan, Vegetarian Pasta
- Desserts: Chocolate Lava Cake, Tiramisu, Cheesecake
- Beverages: Soft Drinks, Fresh Juice, Coffee

#### 2. ✅ Item Names Not Showing in Payment Page
**Problem:** The payment page wasn't displaying the list of items being paid for.

**Root Cause:** The payment view component didn't have a section to display the order items.

**Solution:**
- Added "Your Order" card section to `client/components/payment-view.tsx`
- Displays each item with:
  - Item name (`menuItemName`)
  - Quantity
  - Line total
- Positioned above "Payment Mode" section for better UX

#### 3. ✅ Item Names Already Showing in Bill Drawer
**Status:** This was already working correctly!

**How it works:**
- Bill items use `menuItemName` field which comes from Django's `name_snapshot`
- The snapshot ensures the name is preserved even if menu item is changed later
- Display in `menu-view.tsx` bill drawer: ✅ Working
- Display in `payment-view.tsx` order section: ✅ Now working

### Data Flow Summary

```
Menu Display:
Django DB (image_url) 
  → Django API (/api/public/menu/{token}) 
  → Next.js API (/api/public/menu/[tableToken]) [transforms image_url → image]
  → Frontend menu-view.tsx (displays item.image)

Bill Items:
Django DB (MenuItem.name) 
  → Bill Line (name_snapshot on creation)
  → Django API (lines[].name_snapshot)
  → Next.js API [transforms name_snapshot → menuItemName]
  → Frontend components (displays menuItemName)
```

### Testing Instructions

1. **Clear old data and reseed:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   python clear_menu.py
   python manage.py seed
   ```

2. **Verify images in menu:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:3000/t/rest1-1/menu
   - All menu items should show food images from Unsplash

3. **Verify bill drawer:**
   - Add items to bill
   - Click "View Bill" button
   - Each item should show name, quantity, and price

4. **Verify payment page:**
   - Go to payment: http://localhost:3000/t/rest1-1/pay
   - "Your Order" section should list all items with names
   - Each item shows: name, quantity, line total

### Files Modified

1. `server/core/management/commands/seed.py` - Added image_url to all menu items
2. `client/components/payment-view.tsx` - Added "Your Order" card section
3. `server/clear_menu.py` - New utility script to clear menu data

### Notes

- All images use Unsplash URLs with `w=400&h=400&fit=crop` parameters
- Images are properly sized and cropped for consistent display
- Item names are "snapshot" at time of order to preserve historical accuracy
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
